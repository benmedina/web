		<pre>The white pieces go on the first and second ranks, while the black pieces go on the seventh and eight ranks.
			
The white pawns go along the second rank and the black pawns go along the seventh rank.

Starting from A1, the white pieces are ordered as follows:
Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook

Starting from A8, the black pieces are ordered in the same way.

		<h2> How do you move the pieces? </h2>
		<pre>The pawns can move two spaces up on their first move and one space up every move after that. They can capture one square diagonally forward.

Rooks can move and capture along any file, but not diagonally.
<a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTGAfIlnfwa8NgE-wLNCeQp61nD6x3U_nj6Ow&usqp=CAU">Rooks</a> are worth 5 "points."

Knights can move and capture in an L shape, going two squares up, down, left, or right and then moving one square to the left or right.
<a href="http://clipart-library.com/images/8cG66aMni.png">Knights</a> are worth 3 "points"

Bishops can move and capture along any diagonal, but can only stay on their color (ex: white's black squared bishops can only move along black squared diagonals).
<a href="https://images.all-free-download.com/images/graphiclarge/bishop_chess_clip_art_20439.jpg">Bishops</a> are worth 3 "points".

Queens can move and capture along any file or diagonal, as many squares as you want.
<a href="https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/219-2192054_black-clip-art-at-clker-com-vector-queen.png">Queens</a> are worth 8 "points".

<a href="http://clipart-library.com/images/8TE5qqjTa.png">Kings</a> can move and capture one square in an direction.

		<h2> Rules of Chess </h2>
	<pre>At the start of every game both players set up their pieces and shake hands. White always starts the game and you can only move on piece at a time.
Sometimes there is a clock that you must hit after each move.

There are only three outcomes to every chess game: win, loss, or draw.
You can draw by agreeing to it with your opponent, by stalemate (someone can't make a legal move), or by threefold repetition (same position three times).
You win by putting your opponent in checkmate and you lose by getting put in checkmate.

Checkmate consists of two parts: check and mate.
A check is when the king is under attack. However he can still move, block, or capture the attacking piece.
It only becomes checkmate when the king is under attack and has no way to defend himself.

**You can't lose or trade your king**

Here is a game where white <a href="https://simplifychess.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Checkmate_1_1.png">checkmates</a> black. The king is placed in check by the rook and can't escape to the g-file because of the knight.
		
When the game is over both players shake hands.

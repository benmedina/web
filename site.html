	            <p>
Chess is a fun game and is super accessible. You only need two people to play and a lot of people have a chess set just laying around in their house. Also, there are a ton of free chess resources online. <br> <br>
For example: <br>
	<a href="https://www.chess.com/home">chess.com</a> <br>
	<a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess.org</a> <br>
	<a href="https://www.chesstempo.com/home">chesstempo.com</a> <br>
	<a href="https://www.chessbomb.com/">chessbomb.com</a> <br> <br>
Some of these sites are only educational, but some allow you to play with anybody in the world with an internet connection. Finally, your age and physical capabilities are not restrictions in the game of chess.

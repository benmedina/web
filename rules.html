            <p> 
At the start of every game both players set up their pieces and shake hands. White always starts the game and you can only move on piece at a time. Sometimes there is a clock that you must hit after each move. There are only three outcomes to every chess game: win, loss, or draw. You can draw by agreeing to it with your opponent, by stalemate (someone can't make a legal move), or by threefold repetition (same position three times).
You win by putting your opponent in checkmate and you lose by getting put in checkmate.Checkmate consists of two parts: check and mate.
A check is when the king is under attack. However he can still move, block, or capture the attacking piece.
It only becomes checkmate when the king is under attack and has no way to defend himself (you can't lose or trade your king). <br> Here is a game where white <a href="https://simplifychess.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Checkmate_1_1.png">checkmates</a> black. The king is placed in check by the rook and can't escape to the g-file because of the knight.When the game is over both players shake hands.
